PKG_SWJPROJECTS_WHATS_NEW="<h3>SW JPROJECTS v.1.8.0 What's new?</h3><h4>Project filtering options</h4><p>Filtering and sorting options for projects have been added to the settings of the menu item. Now you can show only paid, only free projects, or both types. You can sort projects by ID (novelty), download type, order in Joomla, views (popularity by views) and downloads (popularity by downloads).</p><h4>New project parameter - visibility</h4><p>For some extensions, you want to have an update server and a changelog URL, manage versions, but you don't want to show these extensions in the frontend so that visitors to your site can download and install them themselves. For example, these may be extensions that are installed as dependencies for other extensions, but at the same time have their own separate update server.</p><p>For such cases, you can set the visibility of the project: it can be hidden and the site visitor will not see it in the frontend, search engines will not index it and will not know about the extension page. But your clients' websites will be able to download updates.</p><p>The <code>visible</code> column has been added to the project table in the database, which by default is <code>1</code>.</p><h4>Corrections</h4><p>Fixed the \"download\" button on the page for viewing the documentation of paid projects.</p><p>The link to the donation page has been changed to a link to GitHub.</p><hr/><h3>What is the Joomla version of your developer site?</h3><p>Soon it's time to think about updating the component to the Joomla 4 extension structure. However, it is advisable to understand how many developers have updated their sites to Joomla 4. Suggestions for improving the component and assistance in their implementation are also welcome. I ask all those who are not indifferent to vote by choosing the Joomla version of your site on which SW JProjects is installed and running.</p><p>Please, <a href=\"https://github.com/SeptdirWorkshop/SWJProjects/discussions/103\" target=\"_blank\">go to GitHub discussion</a> and specify the Joomla version of your developer site in the survey.</p>"
